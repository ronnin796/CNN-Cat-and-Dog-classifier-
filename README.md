# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classifier using CNN (Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a **binary image classifier** built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in a Jupyter Notebook. It classifies images of cats and dogs and demonstrates my learning journey from a simple CNN to a more robust model.

## 🔹 Learning Journey & Improvements

### 1️⃣ First Attempt – Simple CNN

- **Architecture:** 2 Conv2D layers, 32 filters, 64×64 images
    
- **Problem:** Poor accuracy (~50–60% on cats)
    
- **Lesson Learned:** Small input size and shallow network couldn’t capture enough features

### 2️⃣ Improved Model – Enhanced CNN

- **Changes Made:**
    
    - Increased **input size** to 128×128
        
    - Added **3rd Conv2D layer** (128 filters)
        
    - Stronger **data augmentation**: rotation, zoom, brightness, horizontal flip
        
    - Added **Dropout (0.5)** for regularization
        
    - Trained for **50+ epochs** with **EarlyStopping**
        

- **Results:**
    
    - Accuracy: ~85–90%
        
    - Cats and dogs predicted reliably
        
    - Learned importance of **depth, input size, and augmentation**

## 🔧 How to Run in Jupyter Notebook

1. Install dependencies:
    

`pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter`

2. Open the notebook:
    

`jupyter notebook`

3. Open the provided notebook file (e.g., `cats_vs_dogs_cnn.ipynb`) and run all cells step by step.
    
4. Make predictions on new images directly within the notebook:
    

`predict_image('path_to_image.jpg')`

## 🖼️ Example Prediction

|Image|Prediction|Confidence|
|---|---|---|
|cat1.jpg|Cat|0.87|
|dog1.jpg|Dog|0.92|

## ✨ Key Concepts Learned

- **Convolutional Layers:** Learn patterns in images (edges, textures, shapes)
    
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce spatial size, control overfitting
    
- **Flatten + Dense Layers:** Map convolutional features to output
    
- **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting
    
- **Data Augmentation:** Makes the model robust to variations
